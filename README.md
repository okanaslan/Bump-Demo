# Bump-Demo

Bump-Demo is a project that automates the documentation generation process. It utilizes two packages:

-   [OpenApi3-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi3-ts): An open-source library for generating OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications from TypeScript classes
-   [TS JSON Schema Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-json-schema-generator): A tool that generates JSON schemas from TypeScript classes

With Bump-Demo, you can easily create comprehensive documentation for your TypeScript projects. Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large enterprise application, Bump-Demo can help make your documentation process more efficient and effective.

To generate documentation, simply run `npm run documentation`.
